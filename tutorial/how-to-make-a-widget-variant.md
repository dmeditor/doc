How to make a widget variant
---------

A widget variant is "configured widget". These configuration includes eg. enabled settings, pre-define data, allowed child widget, styles.

An example is grid, a grid can add all types of widget in a grid, with '3 column article grid' which is a variant of article will only allow article inside, and fixed column 3(not changable because column setting is disabled).
